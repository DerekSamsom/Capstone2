### Capstone Project - Traffic Sign Image Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Network

This project uses convolutional neural networks to classify traffic sign images.  The data comes from the Institute for Neuroinformatik in Germany.  There are 43 classes of traffic signs, and three convolutional neural network architectures are built and trained using TensorFlow.
